<p>Last week I gave a short presentation about lenses and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels">fclabels</a> at the Berlin Haskell Users Group. The source for the slides and some accompanying literate Haskell files are now in a <a href="https://github.com/chriseidhof/presentation-lenses">github repo</a>.</p>{% endblock body %}
