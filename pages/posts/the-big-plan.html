title: The Big Plan


{% extends "post.html" %}

<p><p class="p1">When I was 15, I started my first job as a web developer. I worked for a local computer repair shop, and the clients needed websites, so I designed and built them. I built my first CMS, which my boss dubbed IWOS: Internet Web Online System. I guess that I already learned at that time that having a boss can suck. Fast forward 11 years later, I have had numerous development jobs. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve been a freelance developer. About 3 months ago, I decided to move to Berlin to start a startup with somebody else, which unfortunately didn&#8217;t work out (I might blog more on that later). However, going back to freelance development doesn&#8217;t feel quite right, I really have the urge to do work that lasts longer, to create products instead of doing projects.</p>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m now in a position where I can do that: I have some money saved up, have front-end and back-end skills, can develop iOS appliactions, have read a lot about startups and products, don&#8217;t have big commitments, not planning to start a family soon, don&#8217;t own a house: <em>there really is no more reason to procrastinate longer</em>. I have a lot of ideas for applications, and going to release my first application soon (an app that tracks your location permanently, stores it in a database and lets you export all the data via email). I will use this blog to update on my progress.</p>
<p class="p1">My goal is to set up <em>multiple passive sources of income</em> by selling software. Specifically, I am going to focus on building iOS apps, which I think is the most interesting platform now. In 9 months from now, I want to be able to live off of the income I am making by selling software. I want to have <em>at least 3 products that are available for sale</em>. Until I reach that goal, I am going to make sure my savings will not fall below a certain threshold by doing some freelance jobs. Another important goal is to <em>stay location independent</em>: I am now living in Berlin, but am going to Spain for a few months, and maybe to a different continent after that.</p>
<p class="p1">For me, the most difficult thing will be actually shipping software. I can start really quickly on a project and crank out a lot of code in very little time, but when it comes to polishing the details and doing the non-programming work I tend to slack off. Therefore, by making this public commitment I hope to push myself a little, and also inspire other people. By the way, my biggest source of inspiration is the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> community.Â </p>
