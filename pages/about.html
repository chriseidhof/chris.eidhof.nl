  I'm Chris Eidhof. Dutch, and living in Berlin.
  
  I build iOS and Mac apps, such as [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com). It's a Mac app that lets you create beautiful presentations, straight from Markdown.

  Recently, I wrote a book: [Functional Programming in Swift](http://www.objc.io/books/).
  
  In 2013, I started [objc.io](http://objc.io), a magazine for iOS developers, together with my friends Florian and Daniel. Every month, we release a new issue with a different topic.
  Also, that year we started [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com). It's an independent conference for serious iOS developers, in Berlin, which is now run by other people. I like speaking at conferences and meetups, [here](https://github.com/chriseidhof/speaking)'s a list of recent talks.
